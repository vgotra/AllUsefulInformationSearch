# Auis.FileUtility

Just a cross-platform project for easy download files (by chunks if possible) on every OS with using resources of CLR

Maybe extracting of 7z files will be added later (if it will be needed)

It's much easier to use simple app which use minimal resources of OS than to use some heavy libraries/apps (PowerShell takes about 70 mb at Windows)

## Notes

Also, can be useful to rewrite c++ LZMA SDK to C# (for 7z files extracting), even if this can be slower, but this can be much more useful for cross-platform projects
